## Notes for the future
### Additional Items to consider for future projects:
  - How do sockets actually work? Is there another server managing the calls? Seems to be like so for Pusher. How would I create one myself?
  - State management across child components. useContext is a bit annoying, maybe look into Redux?
### Database (Prisma)
  - Relationships need to be defined on both models as defined within Prisma
  - Information can be lost if only tracked on one model
